# Chinese Zodiac Game
This zodiac calendar game was created in school to practice creating elements and designing them in JavaScript. 
We learned how to add event listeners towards changing images and applying sound. My idea was the game redirecting 
to the home page after ten seconds when the game is over. I want the user to take time to read their total attempts, total answers correct
and their score.
